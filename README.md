# moa-project
"Mechanism of Action" Kaggle Project (CS3244 Machine Learning Team Project)

## Description
This is a multi-label classification problem based on how cells and genes react to different medical drugs. I conducted exploratory data analysis and visualization on dataset of 23814 samples comprising of almost 900 features and 207 target labels in Python, and performed feature engineering based on insights from analysis, including quantile transformations on skewed data and Principal Component Analysis. I then worked with team to deploy various machine learning models such as simple neural networks, XGboost, TabNet. We ultimately clinched the Silver Medal on Kaggle
